    title: Virtual CTO
    content: >
      We love helping private lenders and would be happy to provide a free
      review of your current tech enablement—our philosophy is "if it isn't
      broke, don't fix it" and we never advocate technology where not needed. We
      can look at your whole stack from website to origination to borrower
      service and recommend easy, inexpensive improvements with off-the-shelf
      tools where possible. If you'd like we can serve as a fractional CTO to
      help with both day-to-day needs as well as discrete projects.
