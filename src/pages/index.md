    content: >
      We love helping private lenders and would be happy to provide a free
      review of your current tech enablement—our philosophy is "if it isn't
      broke, don't fix it" and we never advocate technology where not needed. We
      can look at your whole stack from website to origination to borrower
      service and recommend easy, inexpensive improvements with off-the-shelf
      products.
